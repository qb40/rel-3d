<h2>II. Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this article is to try to explain the reasons behind 3d projection and a little on 2d rotation.
3d is only as hard, or as easy, as you want it to be. Don't be afraid as I'll take you to the world of 3d step
by step.</p>

<p>What you need to be able to run the sample programs that I will be throwing from time to time is any flavor of
QuickBASIC (QBASIC, QB 4.5, 7.1, etc). A little experience in algebra and Trig is also a plus but not necessary. I
will also try to explain optimization techniques as we go along the whole series. ;*)</p>

<h2>III. 3d cartesian coordinate system</h2>

<p>The 3d cartesian coordinate system is almost like the 2d cartesian coordinate system that we grew up with, only
with an extra dimension: The Z axis. <i>*There are several other 3d coordinate systems like spherical and cylindrical.
I will explain them to you in detail in future issues, but when I talk 3d coordinates for now, its the cartesian
coordinate system unless specified.</i></p>

ie.
<ol type="a">
<li>2d
  <dl><dd>p(x,y)</dd></dl>
</li>
<li>3d
  <dl><dd>P(x,y,z)</dd></dl>
</li>
</ol>

<p>But how do we define a 3d coordinate? Where does the z-axis go? As we know already, in 2d coordinate, the x-axis
is going to the right and the y-axis is going up.  The 2 axes (plural for axis) intersect at p(0,0). Read as
"Point 0,0" where the first value is the x (abscissa) and the second value is the y (ordinate). P(0,0) is also called
the "Origin". They are also PERPENDICULAR to each other. Perpendicular means a line, plane or a ray (vector) which
has a union of 90 degrees. Meaning they form a "+" when they intersect.</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="perp.png">
</div>

<p>See how all the angles (1, 2, 3, 4) are all 90 degrees? That's the essence of perpendicularity. Also be sure that
you understand this concept as perpendicularity is used on almost all things that got to do with 3d. <i>*Perpendicular
lines/Planes/rays are also called "orthogonal".</i></p>

<p>There is not that much difference in 3d, all the axes are perpendicular to each other. ie:
Z axis is perpendicular to the XY Plane, Y axis is perpendicular to the XZ plane as the X axis to the YZ plane.
Now how about the directions the axes go? Well, there are two ways to define a 3d system. The "RIGHT-HANDED" and the
"LEFT-HANDED" systems. The choice is yours to make, or me in this case because I'm the one writing this article.</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="3dsys.png">
</div>

<ol type="a">
<li>Left handed system (Fig. 2)
  <dl>
    <dd>The left-handed system means that when increased:
      <dl><dd>x goes right</dd></dl>
      <dl><dd>y goes Up</dd></dl>
      <dl><dd>z goes into the screen (away from you)</dd></dl>
    </dd>
  </dl>
</li>
<li>Right Handed system (Fig. 1)
  <dl>
    <dd>When increased:
      <dl><dd>x goes right</dd></dl>
      <dl><dd>y goes up</dd></dl>
      <dl><dd>z goes out of the screen (Into you)</dd></dl>
    </dd>
  </dl>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Since most books use the right handed system, I'll use that system. Another reason is that the coordinates when
plotted on the screen, resembles a real-world system. Hey, I'm right handed. ;*)</p>

<h2>IV. 3d to 2d projection</h2>

<p>As you might have guessed, QB has no PSET3d or LINE3d routine so we have to make one. :*) The beauty of learning
the theories and principles behind how things work is that you won't get lost at discussions on forums. :*) So let
me start by the principle:</p>

<p>Normal way: <i>"The farther the thing from the viewer the smaller it gets"</i><br />
Jocke's way: <i>"I'm gonna kick this ball so far you won't be able to see it."</i><br />
Math way: <i>"Distance is inversely proportional to the size of an object"</i></p>

<p>Trying to make an equation using Jocke's or the English statement would be very hard. So we'll use the Math way:</p>

<div class="code">
Size = 1/distance<br />
</div>

<p>so:</p>

<div class="code">
Newsize = Size/Distance<br />
</div>

<p>assume:</p>

<div class="code">
a.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; OrigSize = 100<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Distance = 1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 100/1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 100<br />
b.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Origize = 100<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Distance = 50<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 100/50<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 2<br />
</div>

<p><i>*This is just an approximation.  Just to show you the relationship of size and distance.</i></p>

<p>Now you would want to project and object but how do we do it with the knowledge that we have already learned?
Well, First, we have to decide where z=0 is. Turns out that a good way to define z=0 is a number of units away from
you. Which means that you can see it when you look at your monitor. A good value is 256. Why 256?  Well, this is not
entirely the law since you could make it as small or as big as you want it to be, but 256 is a good multiplier (or
any power of 2 value) as you will see later. Secondly, where to put the monitor in our 3d space. Think of your monitor
as a <b>"camera"</b> that points onto the 3d space and the screen as the LENS (camera lens) perpendicular to the z-axis
(Yes, your XY plane). Since (0,0,0) or z=0 is at a distance of 256 looking at the negative direction, our Lens should
be 0+256. So that the coordinate of our lens is (0,0,256).</p>

<p>Anything more than 256 is behind the camera and should not be plotted. Remember that we are looking on the negative z
in right-handed systems.</p>

<p><i>And why did we use 256?</i></p>

<p>Seasoned programmers would know that 256 is a power of two. Since you can use shifts to multiply and divide, you
could make your renders faster by miles as shifts are way faster than divs or muls. ;*)</p>

<p>In screen 13, the dimensions of the screen is 320*200 and its center is (160,100). We know that at z=0, the
relationship of each x,y,z units is that x and y is one unit wide. So plotting (8,5,0):</p>

<div class="code">
Distance = 256<br />
&nbsp;screenx = 160+x<br />
&nbsp;screeny = 100-y (the screen y-wise is reversed)<br />
</div>

<p>Then:</p>

<div class="code">
Screenx = 160 + 8 = 168<br />
Screeny = 100 - 5 = 95<br />
Pset(168,95), col<br />
</div>

<p>How about if z = 128? (8,5,128)</p>

<p>Then:</p>

<div class="code">
distance = 256 -128<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 128<br />
</div>

<p>128 is nearer which means the size of the units should increase. But how much? Since 128 is half of 256, our units
should be 2x (twice) the size of the units at z=0. So...</p>

<div class="code">
screenx = 160+x*2=160+8*2<br />
screeny = 100-y*2=100-y*2<br />
</div>

<p>Then:</p>

<div class="code">
Screenx = 160 + 16 = 176<br />
Screeny = 100 - 10 = 90<br />
Pset(168,95), col<br />
</div>

<p>Pretty easy huh?  Putting it all together, the projection would look like this:</p>

<div class="code">
Distance = LENS-z<br />
&nbsp;screenx = xcenter+(LENS*x/Distance)<br />
&nbsp;screeny = ycenter-(LENS*y/Distance)<br />
</div>

<p>Now let me explain how each component affects the whole projection formula:</p>

<h2>1. Lens</h2>

<p>We know that LENS, the lens of our camera or monitor in this case, is a multiplier to give your projection a field
of view(FOV) and since the camera is 256 units away from (0,0,0) we would want the value of our lens to have a direct
correlation with distance. eg:</p>

<div class="code">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;z = 0<br />
Distance = 256-0 = 256<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lens = 256<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x = 8<br />
&nbsp;xcenter = 160<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= (256*8/256)+160 = 168<br />
</div>

<p><i>(See the relationship already?)</i></p>

<p><i>* some people use a value of Lens=1 so that it weeds out 2 muls or shifts in the actual projection formulas but in
my experience, the objects does not look "natural".</i></p>

<h2>2. Distance</h2>

<p>This is just how far a 3d pixel is away from the camera. Since we look in the negative direction,
"The farther the distance, the smaller the z value. ie. p(0,0,-100) is further than p(0,0,100). Let us see if this holds
true in equation form.</p>

<div class="code">
a. (0,0,-100)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Distance = 256-(-100)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'distribute the [-] sign:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Distance = 256+100<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Distance = 356<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
b. (0,0,100)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Distance = 256-(+100)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Distance = 256-100<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Distance = 156<br />
</div>

<p>Ahem! 356>156. ;*)</p>

<p>What about z=>256 or distance is 0 or less? Well, unless you want to poke yourself in the eye, you wouldn't want to
plot em. ;*)  Plotting at distance=0 is technically correct but you had to change your projection formula because n/0 is
undefined. And in geometry, <i>"Distance is always positive :*)"</i>  Here's the formula:</p>

<div class="code">
Distance = 0<br />
&nbsp;screenx = xcenter+(LENS*x)<br />
&nbsp;screeny = ycenter-(LENS*y)<br />
</div>

<p>
To test your intelligence, I'll let you think about it yourself. ;*)</p>

<h3>FINAL PROJECTION EQUATIONS!!!</h3>

<div class="code">
Distance = LENS-z<br />
&nbsp;screenx = xcenter+(LENS*x/Distance)<br />
&nbsp;screeny = ycenter-(LENS*y/Distance)<br />
</div>

<p>or (since addition is commutative):</p>

<div class="code">
Distance = LENS-z<br />
&nbsp;screenx = (LENS*x/Distance)+xcenter<br />
&nbsp;screeny = -(LENS*y/Distance)+ycenter<br />
</div>

<p>Now let's see if the projection equations would return the same values for (8,5,128): 
Remember that we returned x=176, y=90)</p>

<div class="code">
Distance = 256-128=128<br />
&nbsp;screenx = (256*8/128) + 160<br />
&nbsp;screeny =-(256*5/128) + 100<br />
=<br />
&nbsp;screenx = (2048/128) + 160<br />
&nbsp;screeny =-(1280/128) + 100<br />
=<br />
&nbsp;screenx = (16) + 160 = 176<br />
&nbsp;screeny =-(10) + 100 = 90<br />
</div>

<p>Ahem...;*)</p>

<h2>V. Translation</h2>

<p>Translation is just movement of a point from one location to another. To simplify things, I put the translation
coords in the form of a camera offsets, camx,camy,camz.</p>

<p>Moving the location of the point is just as simple as adding or subtracting values to the camera offsets and
subtracting those components; x,y & z from p(x,y,z) ie:</p>

<div class="code">
Xtranslated = x - camx<br />
Ytranslated = y - camx<br />
Ztranslated = z - camx<br />
</div>

<h2>VI.  Putting it in action</h2>

<p>Now for the fun part, plotting! Let's start by the simplest of all "models" (When I say models i mean an array of
points that define a 3d object), the plane. In this case we want to plot a grid of 16*16 plane. As we would want the
grid to be centered at x=0 and y=0, the starting x and y values of our grid is negative. We also would want to start
at z=0 adding an increment(20) for every y-loop.  We also would want to scale the distance between each point, in this
case 4.</p>

<div class="code">
Gsize = 16<br />
size% = Gsize * Gsize&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'16 * 16 grid<br />
DIM SHARED Plane(size% - 1) AS Point3D&nbsp; &nbsp; 'dim out plane<br />
<br />
Scale = 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'scale factor<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'change to a smaller if you want to<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'reduce the size.<br />
z = 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'start 256 units away from screen<br />
i = 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'index for pixels<br />
<br />
HalfSize = Gsize \ 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; '1/2 of our grid for centering<br />
FOR y = HalfSize - 1 TO -HalfSize STEP -1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'loop through it<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; FOR x = HalfSize - 1 TO -HalfSize STEP -1 'and calculate each coord<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Plane(i).x = x * Scale&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'make the model bigger<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Plane(i).y = y * Scale<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Plane(i).z = z<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i = i + 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'increment array index<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; NEXT x<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; z = z + 20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'go out into the screen 20 units every line.<br />
NEXT y<br />
</div>

<p>Now to project it,</p>

<ol>
<li>start</li>
<li>read pixel at location i</li>
<li>translate the pixel using p(x,y,z) - cam(x,y,z)</li>
<li>project each pixel</li>
<li>Plot</li>
<li>If I&lt;maxpoints go to start else end</li>
</ol>

<div class="code">
FOR i = 0 TO UBOUND(Plane)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; sx! = Plane(i).x - camx%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'coords<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; sy! = Plane(i).y - camy%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'sub tracted by the<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; sz! = Plane(i).z - camz%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'camera<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'we can still directly subtract<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'camera offsets to our original<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'coords as we are not rotating yet. ;*)<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Distance% = (LENS - sz!)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'get Distance<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; IF Distance% &gt; 0 THEN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'if dist&gt;&gt;0 then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Projection formula<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; x% = XCENTER + (LENS * sx! / Distance%) <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; y% = YCENTER - (LENS * sy! / Distance%) <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PSET (x%, y%), 15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Draw each star<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'always positive. ;*)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; END IF<br />
NEXT i<br />
</div>

<p>Now here's the example file of a projected plane:<br />
(camera is controlled by AZSXDC)<br />
<a href="project.bas" target="_blank">project.bas</a></p>

<p>You can even project texts:<br>
<a href="projchar.bas" target="_blank">projchar.bas</a></p>

<p>Here's how you can apply the projection equations to a starfield:<br />
<a href="projstar.bas" target="_blank">projstar.bas</a></p>

<h2>VII. Using sprites instead of pixels</h2>

<p>Pixels alone tend to be boring after a while.  So why not use sprites?  Considering we also have to project the
size of the sprite or tile, we can't use the normal QB PUT routine, so we have to make a stretch sprite routine for
this purpose alone.  The algo behind the stretch sprite routine is pretty trivial so I won't explain it here in
detail. All you have to remember is that you could zoom or pan on a sprite depending on the parameters, NewHeight
and NewWidth.</p>

<p>For the actual algo in calculating the new dimensions, here's the formula:</p>

<div class="code">
NewHeight = OldHeight*LENS/Distance%<br />
&nbsp;NewWidth = OldWidth*LENS/Distance%<br />
</div>

<p>OldWidth and OldHeight are the actual dimensions of the sprite. Ie. If you GET(0,0)-(15,15),Array then the size
of the sprite is 16*16. So OldHeight=16 and OldWidth=16.</p>

<p>Distance is the same distance in out projection equations. Same with the LENS. I'll let you figure out the
rationale behind the equations yourself. :*)</p>

<p>Here's the sample file:<br />
<a href="meteor.bas" target="_blank">meteor.bas</a><br />
<a href="stars.bas" target="_blank">stars.bas</a></p>

<p>Hope you've learned something from this. The best way to learn though is to just play with the values, running the
program and see the effect of the changed values.</p>

<p>Next time, I will teach you 2d and 3d rotations, polar coodinates, other forms of transformation besides translation,
optimizations of 3d rotations using constants, and probably if space will provide 3d model generation (The math way).
